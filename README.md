# MVC Projects

Welcome to the MVC 

We will create a bookStore with EntityFramework using a MVC Web Template(with individual User Authentication)

We transfer data from bookController to IndexView using ViewBag

Properties will have Data Annotations 

We change the connection string so we can use Sql Server Database and not the IIS Express of VisualStudio

Using Scaffolding we create a GRUD for the class book

We Create a BookDbInitializer to initialize data to the database using the method seed

We create a connection to the Global.asax
